# Statistics & Probability Theorem

## Description: 

This project was done as part of the final assignment for a course. This was purely included in this portfolio to showcase my familiarity with RStudio and core statistics theories. 

## Techniques & Tools

This project was done on RStudio, witht eh report being done on Microsoft Word. This assignment covers core statistics theories, including Monte Carlo simulations and the Central Limit Theorem.

## Acknowledgments: 

This was initially done as an individual assignment for the STAT2011 (Probability and Estimation Theory) course by University of Sydney. This was then modified by Kylie Haryono.
